"""Generate route that can be made into User Motion File based on two locations.

Classes for Location, Route, and TimedRoute. A Route is a list of points that
connect a user given start and end location. TimedRoute is a child class of
Route and incorporates a user specified speed of travel and point frequency,
which can be used to create a user motion file (10 Hz) with various simulated
speeds (walking, running, biking)

  Typical usage example:
  user_motion = TimedRoute(location1,location2,TRANSPORT_SPEEDS["walking"],10)
  user_motion.create_route()
  user_motion.write_route("usermotiontestfile.csv")
